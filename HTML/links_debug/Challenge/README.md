# Debugging - Fix Broken Links

## Context
As a web developer, it is essential to be able to debug and fix issues in code. One common issue is broken links, which can prevent users from accessing the intended content. In this assignment, you will practice your debugging skills by fixing broken links in an HTML file.

## Task List
